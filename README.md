## Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Installation
üöÄ **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isaacayomi/Entertainment-web-app.git
```

üì¶ **Navigate to Project Directory:**
```bash
cd entertainment-web-app
```

‚öôÔ∏è **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables
This project uses Supabase for its backend services. You'll need to configure your Supabase project URL and public API key.

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
```

*   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://abcdefg1234.supabase.co`).
*   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase public "anon" key.

**Note**: Ensure your Supabase `catalog` table is set up with appropriate RLS (Row Level Security) policies to allow authenticated users to read and update `isBookmarked` status. Also, set up authentication via email/password in your Supabase project.

### Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage
Upon launching the application, you will be greeted by the login/sign-up page.

1.  **Sign Up**: If you are a new user, navigate to the "Sign up" page, provide your email and password to create an account.
2.  **Login**: Once registered, log in with your credentials.
3.  **Browse Content**: After logging in, you'll land on the homepage, which displays trending content and recommended movies and TV series.
4.  **Navigation**: Use the sidebar/navbar to switch between "Home", "Movies", "TV Series", and "Bookmarked" content.
5.  **Search**: Use the search bar at the top to find specific titles.
6.  **Bookmark**: Click the bookmark icon on any movie or TV series card to add or remove it from your bookmarked list.
